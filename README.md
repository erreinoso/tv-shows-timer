# TV Shows Timer :movie_camera:

This is the proposal for an app that will show you how much of your time has been spent watching your favourite TV shows. I thought this tool as an inprovement of the [Series Searcher App ](https://github.com/erreinoso/Series-searcher).

This web has a responsive design:

- Desktop size:

- Mobile size:
  ![screenshot of search page - mobile layout](https://github.com/erreinoso/tv-shows-timer/blob/master/readme-screenshot-mobile.PNG)

The user's watched TV shows had to be locally stored so they would remain in the list on future visits to the site. I used html, sass and javascript partials compiled with node/gulp.

Just be warned, the amount of time dedicated to be in the sofa may cause severe disappointment in oneself ðŸ˜‰.

**- Requirements**

- This project we are asked to make a call to [an API](https://www.episodate.com/api), where we can get data from all available TV series.

- After getting all the series stored, we can search for the one we want and add it to a list of already watched series.

- Automatically, the app shows the duration of the set of TV shows watched.

- It will save each of these watched TV shows in Local Storage so we can keep watching them without refreshing the page.

- We can remove the TV show we want from our favorites list.

## Tools ðŸ’»

- Adalab Web Starter Kit tool, through which we automated many of the tasks.
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS - SCSS

## How to run this project? :point_down:

- You need to have Node.js installed

- Clone or download the repository in your computer.

To install local dependencies, type:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
